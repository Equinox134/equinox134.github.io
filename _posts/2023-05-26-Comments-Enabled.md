## Lets Goooooooooooooooo

Finally got comments working after so long

Turns out it wasn't that hard

Giscus is awesome

## This Post is too Short

So I'll just write some random stuff

### Stuff I want to do

* Codeforces 1900+
* Get better at Japanese
* Get better at tetris(rank S)
* Learn how to draw
* Get better at programming / problem solving
* Learn more algorithms
* Learn instruments, mostly guitar
* Write more

Looking at it this way there it seems like there isn't much. There might be more that I just can't remember.

But with all the homework and tests going on at school, doing more than two properly is actually hard.

Or I'm just terrible at time management, which is possible.

### Consistency

If I start something, it's best if I do it consistently. However, this is easier said than done.

Usually one would set a goal to reach. However a goal that is poorly made might be too hard or too easy to reach.

I believe that no goal is truly unreachable, if you try hard enough. However, I don't have infinite time and since there are multiple things I want to do, it's hard to continuously focus on one thing.

Most of that can be solved if I just manage my time well enough. After all, the goals I set up don't have a tight deadline. The real problem comes from other stuff.

My current goal for Codeforces is to reach 1900+, at least a candidate master. It's not an unrealistic goal. Since my current rating is somewhere around 1800, I just have to do a little bit better, like reading the problem properly on my first try or something.

However the fear of doing badly in a contest and my rating falling faster than ever often stops me from entering a contest. Also, the pressure of competition can make things more stressful than it actually is.

My solution to the first problem was to lose interest in my rating, which is paradoxical, as my goal is based on that rating. Whether I completely lose interest in it or not, the point is to stop being afraid of falling down, and know if that I do fall down, I can get back up.

The second problem is harder to solve than that though. The source of the second problem comes from competition. Basically I'm trying to be better than someone, or I'm trying to reach a certain place on the scoreboard. Because of competition, situations can become more stressful than necessary, making things that were fun, frustrating, and lowering my overall performance.

Of course, it is possible for me to just lose interest in competition. Or is it? Codeforces rating is something that's only well-known by some of my friends, and like one of my teachers. My rank for Codeforces and other competitions however, is a number everyone knows exists, and is constantly being asked by people around me, including parents. This makes it hard for me to ignore, and forces me to rank higher, not in a good way.

Recently, I started learning Japanese by myself (I might upload progress here, maybe not). In the case of Japanese, I'm doing it all by myself, so there's no competition other than myself. No tests that are reported to my parents. Because I'm all by myself, I just have to worry about meeting my expectations, my goals, and no one else's. Since the source of motivation comes from me, the process of learning and getting better isn't stressful, and I can consistently practice and learn.

Some people achieve consistency and motivation from competition with others. However, that doesn't seem to be the case for me. I achieve consistency when I am motivated by myself, if that makes any sense. I do the things I do because they're what gives me joy. When someone else interferes then stuff becomes boring and stressful. Hence, I feel like I achieve the highest consistency when I do things alone. Or maybe not, but that what it currently seems like.

Okay, that was long with probably just a bunch of obvious an boring stuff, but this is my blog so who cares.

I wanted to write something more, but I'm not to sure about it, so I'll leave that for later.

Anyway the point of this post is that comments are enabled now.
